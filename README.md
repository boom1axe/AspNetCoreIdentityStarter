# AspNetCoreIdentityStarter
This will be a starter template with ASP.NET Identity configured. The goal is to remove a lot of the manual Identity configuration students
might need for starting their projects and focus on other tasks.

## Roadmap
Here are the tasks that will be accomplished/set up in this template
- [X] Register with username and email (instead of defaulting username to email)
- [ ] Require unique email
- [ ] Password strength configuration
- [ ] Add custom roles to database seed
- [ ] Manage users and add/remove roles to users using a web page
- [ ] Email verification (using SendGrid as example)
- [ ] Phone number verification (using Twilio as example)
- [ ] 2FA with authenticator app or SMS
- [ ] Add authorization configuration
- [ ] Add default admin user with seed data

## Prerequisites
- Template targets [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
